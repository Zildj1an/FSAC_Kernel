| 8  | /mm/page-writeback.c         | FSAC RT tasks should get special treatment when it comes to writing back dirty pages at the address-space.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 10 | /kernel/sched/core.c         | Make sure no Linux balancing, integrate FSAC scheduling class. Also, add hooks for the preemption state machine, like sched_state_entered_schedule() at __schedule(), which flags WILL_SCHEDULE. Per-cpu bool fsac_preemption_in_progress updated in   __schedule(). Also in fsac_fork I add if (is_fsac(p)){ p->sched_class = &fsac_sched_class;} |
