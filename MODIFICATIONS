File created:		              Purpose:
-------------                     -----------
1 /fsac/fsac.c		              Initialize everything,including the proc and registers the dummy plugin. 
2 /fsac/fsac_list.c	              Help with the management of the special linked lists, and the copy from user.	
3 /fsac/fsac_plugin.c	          Dummy FSAC plugin(default) also manages the list of registered plugins.
4 /fsac/fsac_proc.c	              Manages the /proc entry. Check laoded plugins, check/change active plugin, stats on it.
5 /include/fsac/fsac.h            Header of (1). Also includes auxiliar definitions/functions.
6 /include/fsac/fsac_list.h       Header of (2). Also includes auxiliar function.
7 /include/fsac/fsac_macros.h     Some macros of FSAC.
8 /include/fsac/fsac_proc.h       Header of (4).

File modified:		              Why:
--------------                    -----------
9  /kernel/sched/sched.h		  Make FSAC a valid policy, add it to the linked list as highest. 
10 /include/uapi/linux/sched.h    Add macro SCHED_FSAC (7).
11 /kernel/sched.c                Hook to fsac_do_exit() from fsac.h when do_exit is called (ln. 729)
12 /fs/select.c                   Needed to avoid delays if the FSAC plugin is real-time.
13 /kernel/locking/mutex.c        Needed to avoid live-lock if the FSAC plugin is real-time.
14 /kernel/locking/rwsem-xadd.c   Same idea as (13) but with semaphores.
15 /kernel/time/hrtimer.c         Same idea as (13) but for the kernel timer.
16 /mm/page-writeback.c           FSAC Real-time tasks should get special treatment when it comes to writing back dirty pages at the address-space.
17 /mm/page_alloc.c               Special amendments at page allocation when the FSAC plugin is intended to be real-time.
